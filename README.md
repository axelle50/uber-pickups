# Project with Jedha

Imagine working for Uber: <br />
"One of the main pain point that Uber's team found is that sometimes drivers are not around when users need them. [...] Therefore, Uber's data team would like to work on a project where their app would recommend hot-zones in major cities to be in at any given time of day." <br />
Paris on April 2022. 

## Objective
The objective is to create algorithms that will determine where are the hot-zones that drivers should be in. Therefore:

- Create an algorithm to find hot zones
- Visualize results on a nice dashboard

## Dataset
The dataset was given by Jedha [New York City pickups](https://full-stack-bigdata-datasets.s3.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/Machine+Learning+non+Supervis%C3%A9/Projects/uber-trip-data.zip).

## Prerequisites

### Dependencies
- The source code is written in Python 3.
- The python packages can be installed with pip : `pip3 install -R requirements.txt` TODO add requirements.txt

## Usage
### Extract dataset from archive
You should extract uber-raw-data-apr14.csv located in uber-trip-data from uber-trip-data.zip

### Apply_models.ipynb
**Trains clustering algorithms (K-means vs DBScan) and compare their performances. Then use the best one to output hot zones.**
- Input file : uber-raw-data-apr14.csv
- Output file : TODO output result.csv

### Visualise_results.ipynb
**Visualise results that could be used by uber drivers**
- Input file : TODO output result.csv
